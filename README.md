# ParallelAlgorithms

C/C++ implementation of various parallel algorithms, including 
* **Linear Algebra**
* **Communication** (i.e. `Broadcast`, `MapReduce`, `Gather`, etc.)
* **Sorting**

## Currently implemented

* theoretical implementation of shared-memory algorithms for CRCW PRAM machines
* matrix multiplication for distributed-memory machines using MPI (untested)
